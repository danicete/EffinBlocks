						<li>He was a student at Morehouse again in 1972, when he made his film debut with a supporting role in Together for Days, a low-budget drama about interracial dating.</li>
						<li>Jackson also drank heavily and did more than his share of cocaine. He completed drug rehab in 1991, later playing a drug addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever, his first post-rehab role and his breakthrough performance.</li>
